      <p>the american dream is a fundamental truth of this country. anyone can achieve anything. the only limit is the depth of your imagination. i personally believe and support this, as your good ol uncle sam, but some people take advantage of this wonderful concept exclusive to this shining star of a country alone. and that's what some lawmakers are trying to use to accomplish their evil, illuminati motivated goals. <br><br>
        they want to pass house bill 69, what they are calling the <u>healthier lives for youth</u> bill. in the proposed law, monster energy, and their less delisious competators, would only be allowed to be sold to people over the age of 21. that is the law we have for alcohol, something much more serious than energy drinks, yet we still allow some exceptions to the 21 and above law like communion or letting parents decide. <br>
        well, where is the equality here?<br></p>
      <p>so now lets assume that this law goes into effect. i'll tell you the story of what will happen to <u>you</u>, an average monster energy enjoyer under the age of 21. </p>

          <p> now here on the left we have a photo of you. you're holding your american flag as you do every morning while you watch the news. nothing out of the ordinary there. but then. socialist implant and part time robot, judy woodruff, announces the news. <br></p>
          <p>the law has already taken into effect, she says, but you're not really that worried. you have a full stock of monster that will last you at least a month, so you're okay. you're fine. so you take your american flag and walk into the kitchen, news hour still playing in the background, only to find that there is no monster left. <br></p>
        </div>
      <div class="col-12">
        <br>
        <p>there's no monster and below you see your reaction. one of confusion and anger, bamboozlement and fury. the racoon must have gotten in again... this is the third fucking time. you'll buy some new locks at home depot soon you tell yourself. but you said that last time, so who knows. <br></p>
        <p>for several brief hours, you sit in your anger, festering and questioning your next course of action. you don't know where the racoon lives, so you can't steal your monster back. there would be the possibility of stealing from a friend or family member, but you were disowned two years ago for using your mother's good silver for heroin and have zero friends. mostly due to the heroin problem. but it's okay, uncle sam still loves you<br></p>

      <div class="col-7">
        <p>then something catches your ear. this law effort was started by the greatest cuck to climate change that ever lived-- gavin newsom.<br></p>
        <p>if he's taking away the one good thing in your life, then it's only fair that you do the same. but gavin, not unlike yourself, has very few things left and he's not up for reelection for another year. so what do you do?<br></p>
        <p>you then plot and attempt to kill california state governor, gavin newsom.<br></p>

      </div>
      <div class=col-12>
        <br>
        <p>it's the logical step really. but as it turns out, trying to kill a governor is extremely difficult, so you give up. the right is you right after giving up, and deciding that monster celibacy is your only real option<br></p>
