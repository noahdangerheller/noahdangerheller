      <p>the american dream is a fundamental truth of this country. anyone can achieve anything. the only limit is the depth of your imagination. i personally believe and support this, as your good ol uncle sam, but some people take advantage of this wonderful concept exclusive to this shining star of a country alone. and that's what some lawmakers are trying to use to accomplish their evil, illuminati motivated goals. <br><br>
        they want to pass house bill 69, what they are calling the <u>healthier lives for youth</u> bill. in the proposed law, monster energy, and their less delisious competators, would only be allowed to be sold to people over the age of 21. that is the law we have for alcohol, something much more serious than energy drinks, yet we still allow some exceptions to the 21 and above law like communion or letting parents decide. <br><br>
        well, where is the equality here? <br><br></p>
